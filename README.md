# podslicer 🔪✨

## Description

**WIP. Currently in development.**

A simple command-line application to slice up audio based podcasts into segments with transcriptions,listen to and read individual segments, and track progress.

## Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.11 or above).
- Poetry.
- Uses [`afinfo`](https://ss64.com/osx/afinfo.html) and [`afplay`](https://ss64.com/osx/afplay.html) so MacOS only for now.

## Up and running

Run `make` or `make default` to see all available `Makefile` commands.

First, clone the repository:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:darraghenright/podslicer.git
cd podslicer
```

Then, set up the poetry virtual environment and shell:

```shell
poetry shell
poetry install
```

Optionally, run tests:

```shell
make test
```

Finally run the application:

```shell
make run
```

Enjoy!
